Application should have 3 layer:
1. User Interface Layer ;
2. Domain Layer (Business layer) ;
3. Data layer;

Domain model of this application will consist of a single domain - 'Bank'.

Anticorruption Layer - will be responsible for bringing the source interface to the application interface. (can be as part of validation).

Open Host Service - I guess it is not needed in this application (it is simple). It has sense to use it if we have additional domain..
